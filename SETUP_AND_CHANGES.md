# BloodConnect - Setup Guide and Change Log (latest)

## Round 3 additions (read this first)
| Item | What was done | Free? |
|---|---|---|
| Free push notifications | `push_relay/` (Cloudflare Workers) + `lib/services/push_relay.dart`. Sends generic pushes: to matching donors on a new request, to a donor on invite, to the receiver on accept/decline/complete. Set `pushRelayUrl` in `lib/config/app_config.dart` after following `push_relay/README.md` | Free (Cloudflare free plan) |
| Admin separate login | Admin accounts are created only with `functions/scripts/create_admin.js` and sign in on the admin website (with forgot-password). The mobile app refuses admin accounts and shows an "Admin Login" link that opens the website | Free |
| Nearby / location | Donors can opt in to share an approximate location (~1 km). Receivers get "Sort by nearest" in Find Donor | Free |
| `lastActive` | Saved when the user opens the app | Free |
| Compatibility | A proposed table is included but stays OFF until a doctor approves it | Free |
| Not added | AdMob (kept out so the build cannot break before testing), Google Maps (billing), Firebase Storage pictures (needs Blaze), multi-language | - |

Create your admin (free, run on your computer):
```powershell
cd C:\FlutterProjects\blood_connect\functions
npm install
$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="C:\FlutterProjects\admin.json"
node scripts/create_admin.js admin@example.com "a-strong-password-here"
```
Use a NEW admin email that is not used by a donor/receiver account.


> **Honest status.** Flutter and the Firebase Emulator are not available where this code was written, so it has NOT been
> compiled or run. Verified only: bracket balance of every edited Dart file, and that `functions/index.js`, the admin
> panel script and the rules-test file load / pass a Node syntax check. Run section 2 and send any error text.

## 1. What is new in this version
| # | Request | What was done | Free plan? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Email code at login | Built end to end (`email_otp_screen.dart`, functions `sendLoginOtp` / `verifyLoginOtp`, code stored hashed, 10 min expiry, 5 tries, 1 resend/min). **Switched OFF** by default | **No.** Needs Blaze + a Brevo email key |
| 2 | Light mode after login | New accounts get `Light`. Old accounts that were saved as "System Default" also start Light unless the user chose System in Settings. User can still change it in Settings | Free |
| 3 | Better admin dashboard | Redesigned: sidebar, statistics cards, bar charts, filters, search, confirmation windows, toasts, audit log tab | Free |
| 4 | Better UI | App-wide polish through the theme (smoother page transitions, rounded dialogs / sheets / snackbars, themed progress and buttons). Signup has Country, City, Area. Per-screen redesign was NOT done (needs your screenshots / wishes) | Free |
| 5 | Make it work without Blaze | Suspension now works with Firestore rules only. Live in-app alerts added. Push and email code are behind switches in `lib/config/app_config.dart` (both `false`) | Free |
| 6 | International | Country dropdown, International phone validation, country-aware matching, city matching ignores ", Area" | Free |
| 7 | Missing requirements | Area field, compatibility mechanism (disabled), consent, removed fake-data notifications screen, `REQUIREMENTS_STATUS.md` for your supervisor | Free |

Files changed or added this round: `lib/config/*` (new), `lib/services/{account_gate,live_alerts,app_messenger}.dart` (new),
`lib/screens/email_otp_screen.dart` (new), `main.dart`, `login_screen.dart`, `splash_screen.dart`, `signup_screen.dart`,
`edit_profile_screen.dart`, `profile_screen.dart`, `request_blood_screen.dart`, `find_donor_screen.dart`, both dashboards,
`firestore.rules`, `functions/index.js`, `admin_panel/index.html`, `pubspec.yaml` (added `cloud_functions`).
Deleted: `notifications_screen.dart` (unused, fake data).

## 2. Run (Windows, PowerShell, one by one)
```powershell
cd C:\FlutterProjects\blood_connect
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes
firebase deploy --only hosting
flutter run
```
`firebase deploy --only firestore:rules` is REQUIRED again: the rules changed (suspension, audit log).
`flutter pub get` now also downloads `cloud_functions`. Send me any version-conflict message.

## 3. Admin (free)
1. Make your admin (once): `cd functions`, `npm install`, set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to your key file, then
   `node scripts/set_admin_claim.js your-email`. Keep the key file OUT of the project folder.
2. Open `https://bloodconnect-f8c69.web.app`, sign out/in first so the admin permission loads.
3. Suspend / Enable now works without Blaze.

## 4. Only if you later choose Blaze
Blaze has a free monthly quota but needs a card. Set a billing budget alert first.
- Push: set `pushEnabled = true` in `lib/config/app_config.dart`, then `firebase deploy --only functions`.
  iOS also needs Xcode Push capability + APNs key.
- Email code: create a Brevo account (free tier), verify a sender email, create an API key, then
  `firebase functions:secrets:set BREVO_API_KEY`, set `OTP_SENDER_EMAIL` when asked at deploy, deploy functions, and set
  `emailOtpEnabled = true`. Note: the code screen is an extra step after the password; it is not a server-enforced lock.

## 5. Not done / limits
- Nothing run by me. Expect to fix some compile errors.
- Blood-group compatibility table: must be written by a doctor / blood bank (see `lib/config/blood_compatibility.dart`).
- No distance search, no lat/long, no Google Maps, no AdMob, no multi-language, no Firebase Storage pictures.
- A suspended user keeps a valid login token, but rules block their writes and the app signs them out.
- Legal text is a draft needing professional review.
- Release steps still open: app ID `com.example.blood_connect`, signing key, icon, store listing.
